This folder has table of Cl_kk, Cl_gg, Cl_kg spectra as well as the noise (error for kg) in that spectrum

The files are created from "LensingZ.py" file in python directory. 

The name of the files is of the form
PS_Survey_redshiftXX_beamXX_tempXX.txt
where PS is the power spectrum used (runpb or halofit)
and Survey is the survey used to provide dN/dz.

The files are used as input plotting/kappa_galaxy_plot.py code to create
three panel figures showing signals and noise/error, which is Fig. 1 in the paper. 

**Ignore the bias evolution in the headers, bias evolution needs to be included in the PS being provided to LensingZ**
The P(k, z) or P(k, zeff) in the column names refers to whether the power spectrum
was kept fixed or varying over the redshift slice to calculate Cl_gg and Cl_kg. 
Var_kg(Halofit) is a type, it should be Vary_kg(Zeff) like Cl_gg and Cl_kg


(The subfolder wrong_gg, which may be in your local repo has the incorrect data from 
the previous time when Cl_gg power spectrum was evaluated using incorrect normalization
for tracer kernel)
(The subfolder wrong_cl, which may be in your local repo has the incorrect data from 
the previous time when noise was calculated incorrectly by nothandling the double integral k-rnages
appropriately, as later pointed out by Simone)
(I no longer remember what is in subfolder new, best avoid it). 

The final files are the one in the current folder. 
runpb & runpb2 differ from the Cl-noise that was used to estimate the error. 
runpb2 are the final files that used the full minimum variance noise with polarization going to 
lmax = 5000 and T going to lmax = 3000.
