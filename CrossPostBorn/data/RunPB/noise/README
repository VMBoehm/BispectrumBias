This folder has the files containing the noise in Cl_kk power spectrum, 
for different combinations of experimental beam size (bw) and thermal noise level(dT).
The files contain 
    Cl_kk from the class output (it must be same in all files)
    Cl_kk(lensed) from the class output that gives the lensed spectrum (same in all files)
    column for TT, TE, EB and EE noises, that can be used to calculate minimum variance noise. 
    Instrumental noise for T, E and B (E=B=2*T)

The files *ext* differ from the other files in that these are newer, go to higher ell and 
have TE and EE contributions in addition to TT and EB
*ext2* files have EE and EB going to l = 5000 instead of l = 3000. TT still goes to l = 3000 but Cl (unlenesed) files
only go to \ell = 4500
*ext3* files have EE and EB going to l = 5000 instead of l = 3000. TT still goes to l = 3000 but Cl (unlenesed) files 
only go to \ell = 5500
*ext4* files have EE and EB going to l = 5000 instead of l = 3000. TT still goes to l = 3000 but Cl (unlenesed) files 
only go to \ell = 6500

The files are calculated using noise.py in python folder.
The script to run that file is script_noise.py.
(One job on debug queue takes ~23 minutes)

The files are used in -
LensingZ.py to calculate the noise in Cl_kk and Cl_kg
mcmc_tools.py to calculate the covariance matrix for MCMC chains and all operations dependent on it.
