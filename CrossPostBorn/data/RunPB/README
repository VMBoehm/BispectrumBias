N-body data from the "PB" simulation suite.
The cosmology is OmM=0.292, Lambda=0.708, h=0.69, ns=0.965
omegaB.h^2=0.022 and sig8=0.82.
Each simulation employed 2048^3 particles in a cubic box
of side 1380Mpc/h = 2Gpc.

The linear power spectrum used as input (computed from CAMB)
is given, redshifted to the appropriate redshift, in the
files pklin_z*.txt.  So pklin_z025.txt is for z=0.25.  There
are two columns, k [in h/Mpc] and P(k) [in h/Mpc cubed] with
k spaced evenly in log.

The "galaxy" files are made from an HOD with a step function
at 1e12Msun/h for the centrals and a linear satellite term
of the form Poisson[ (Mhalo-1e12)/10**(13.5) ].  This leads to
a 5% satellite fraction at z=2.  Satellites are placed coincident
with the centrals, i.e. we just upweight the halo, since we are
focused on large scales.

The hh/hm_fine_*.txt files contain the data as 
hh/hm*z*.pkr files, but with shot noise subtracted for
hh files using the value from nbar.txt. The data is also
more finely sampled, evenly in log and extrapolated to k=0.01 
using linear bias (different/corresponding to hh and hm) 
using matter spectra from class_output. 
The files contain 2 columns - k[in h/Mpc] and P(k).

What's in halofit -- which of these halofit files is "wrong"
and which should we use?  Have these been superceded?


What's in class_output?


What's in the joint_fit_results* files and how are they made?
