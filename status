Cross Bias

- the galaxy leg should be associated with L (not l or L-l) in order to comply with TypeA1 and TypeA2 codes
  - flag cross_bias in Spectra_cross.py, recalculate bispectrum for bias, add to git!
  - compute also for extended lensing kernel
  - put all into separate folder 9also I integrals)
  - update interpolated bispectrum for Type1 calculation
  - run also for different delta_theta and full angle

- check that g is at correct position in PostBorn

- test Type A code for different configs 
  - l sampling 256/512 (TypeAdom)
  - ang sampling (TypeAdom1)
  - lcut dependence (TypeAdom2)
  - lmin, lmax dependence (TypeAdom3 lmin, TypeAdom4)
  - ang cutoff
  - look for cancelation at low ell

- need to compile TypeAdomi.pyx and run
  
- check if you integrate correctly for Type1/Type2 bias
- implement for EB
  - same tests for EB
  
- measure bias in simulations with iterative estimator


S/N 

- not that in S/N code g is associated with L3 = Ll, while for Bias Code g must be associated with L (change in Spectra_cross)
- read bias review
- read Takada & Jain
  - how to combine different bins/bispectra?
  

- test Post Born corrections
  - change galaxy kernel to lensing kernel
  - expand galaxy kernel
  - test for different triangle configs
  
- matched S/N with Toshiya?
  - agree on configuration to use (cosmology, bins, noise, experiments)
  
- compute B_kgg and B_kkg S/N

- speed up code for calculation with different parameters settings
